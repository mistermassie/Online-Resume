<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My journey in technology began humbly at an electronics repair shop, where my curiosity about how cell phones worked ignited a passion that would shape my career. Diagnosing and repairing devices like cell phones and game consoles, I quickly realized my knack for understanding complex systems and my drive to solve challenging technical issues. This hands-on experience laid the groundwork for my technical expertise and motivated me to pursue a path that would deepen my skills and broaden my impact.</p>

<p>After joining the U.S. Army, I took my technical abilities to the next level, working in high-stakes environments that demanded both precision and resilience. From securing communication networks to leading IT teams in challenging environments, I found purpose in merging my technical skills with service. Recognitions like the Missile Defender of the Year and commendations for leadership validated my dedication to excellence. These years honed my skills in cybersecurity, network infrastructure, and identity management, preparing me to transition to civilian roles that would push my expertise even further.</p>

<p>Today, I’m passionate about leading in telecommunications and cybersecurity, particularly in the transformative areas of blockchain and digital security. At SAP North America, I’ve been able to set new standards for security and compliance, while my work with Booz Allen Hamilton and Merck allowed me to create solutions that merge traditional security with innovative technologies. As I look ahead, I’m excited to continue pushing boundaries, leveraging my journey from a repair shop technician to a trusted technology leader, and shaping secure digital solutions for the future.
